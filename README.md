# Conan Server Porject

I am starting this project to work on my Devops skills, as well as help improve my game hosting experiance.  
Currently hosting conan exiles on my windows machine, and it is kind of not great.  I would like to move the server to a dedicated linux machine, running in Azure.  

Still very WIP... 

# QuickStart
The base of our setup with be an ubuntu 18.04 machine, running the following:
- Conan Exiles (game server)
- Netdata (host monitoring)
- Discord bot (python/go?, docker container most likely)
